# Instructions

Complete the exercises in this .Rmd file and submit your .Rmd and .pdf output through [Quercus](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/277998/assignments/910603) on September 22 by 5:00 p.m. ET. 

## Question 1

The Week 1 Problem Set included the following code.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
my_answers <- c(r1,r2,c1,c2)
square_answers <- c(10,-1,3,12)
```

For the first three questions below choose the correct answer from the following.

(A) A single value counting how many correct rows and columns you calculated.
(B) A numeric vector of the differences between the math square answers and your answers (should be all 0s if you got them all right).
(C) A character vector of 'TRUE' and 'FALSE', 'TRUE' for each answer that matches and 'FALSE' for any that don't.
(D) A logical vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE`, `TRUE` for each answer that matches and `FALSE` for any that don't.
(E) A single logical value `TRUE` or `FALSE`, `TRUE` if all the values match, `FALSE` if any of the values don't match.


### a) Which of the above best describes what `my_answers == square_answers` is?

C

### b) Which of the above best describes what `sum(my_answers == square_answers)` is?

B

### c) Which of the above best describes what `all(my_answers == square_answers)` is?

E

### d) What is the sequence of steps involved in getting the answer for `sum(c(TRUE,FALSE))`? What additional step is required to get the answer for `sum(my_answers == square_answers)`?

Firstly using 'spec()' to retrieve the full column specification for this data and then specify the column types or set 'show_col_types = FALSE' to quiet this message.

#### Hints
- Your answer should include the word ***coercion***.
- The `sum` function works only on `numeric` data types and does not itself directly know anything about `logical` data types.

## Question 2

The data for this question will be based on a sample of Superbowl ads.

- The data is stored in the file `superbowl_ads.csv` in the same directory as this file,
and includes the following variables:

  - `year` (double) Superbowl year
  - `brand`	(character)	Brand for commercial
  - `funny`	(logical)	Contains humor
  - `show_product_quickly`	(logical))	Shows product quickly
  - `celebrity`	(logical) Contains celebrity
  - `danger`	(logical)	Contains danger
  - `view_count`	(double)	Youtube view count
  - `like_count`	(double)	Youtube like count
  - `dislike_count`	(double)	Youtube dislike count
  - `superbowl_ads_dot_com_url`	(character)	Superbowl ad URL
 
> This data was posted on [github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads#super-bowl-ads) by the data-oriented reporting outlet [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight) and subsequently featured on [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-02/readme.md).  For more information see the above links.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # Load the tidyverse functionality so it is available to use 
superbowl <- read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv")
```

### (a) Use the `glimpse()` function to view properties of the `superbowl` data set. How many rows and columns are there? How many observations does it include? How many variables are measured for each observation? 

```{r}

```

### (b) Create 3 histograms to explore the distribution of `view_count`: (i) one with 2 bins, (ii) one with 8 bins, and (iii) one with 50 bins; make sure to specify meaningful axis labels where appropriate. Which of these histograms is most appropriate to describe the distribution of `view_count`? Why? Write a few sentences describing the distribution based on the histogram you chose as most appropriate.

```{r}
# You can put multiple plots in the same code chunk

```

```{r}
# Or your can put different plots in separate code chunks

```

```{r}
# Feel free to add or remove code chunks as desired

```

### (c) Construct two plots to visualize the distribution of `brand` and one of these other categorical variables:  `funny`, `danger` or `celebrity` from the superbowl ads data and describe the distribution in 1-2 sentences; make sure to specify meaningful axis labels where appropriate. Hint: If you choose a categorical variable with many different categories, you may find it useful to use `coord_flip()` to flip the bars horizontally and/or change the options in the R code chunk to make the plot large (ex: {r, fig.height=15, fig.width=5}).

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}
# One reason to use use different code chunks for different figures is
# to assign different figure aspect ratio controls to different figure

```

*REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR ANSWER*

### (d) Construct a set of two boxplots showing visual summaries of the distribution of number of likes (`like_count`) for whether ads included a celebrity or not (`celebrity`); make sure to specify meaningful axis labels where appropriate. Write 3-4 sentences comparing these distributions.

```{r}
# This should be a single plot, NOT TWO... boxplots can be put in the same plot!

```

## Question 3

The `births` data set is part of the `openintro` package. It consists of random sample of 100 births for babies in North Carolina where the mother was not a smoker and another 50 where the mother was a smoker.   Type `?births` in the R console for more information about the data and to see the definition of each variable. The code below loads the required libraries for this question and provides a glimpse of the `births` data frame.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

```{r}
births %>% glimpse()
```
  
### (a) Choose two categorical variables and plot the distribution of each one (in seperate plots). Identify whether each of these variables is a nominal or ordinal categorical variable. Write one or two sentences interpreting each plot.  

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}

```

*REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR ANSWER*

### (b) Choose a quantitative variable and plot its distribution.  Identify whether the variable you selected is continuous or discrete, and write 2-3 sentences describing the distribution.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}

```

*REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR ANSWER*

### (c) Construct a plot that shows the relationship between birth weight (`weight`) and mother's smoking status (`smoke`); make sure to specify meaningful axis labels where appropriate.  

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}

```

### (d) Construct a plot that shows the relationship between birth weight (`weight`) and gestational age (`weeks`); make sure to specify meaningful axis labels where appropriate.  

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
